<p>This is a sample of my freelance data work for a Hanyang University Ph.D student in 2018 and 2019. I asked for a permission to upload some of my report, and he generously allowed me to do so. My client wanted to read the trend of the era through old newspapers published from the 18th century to the early 19th century. The project took about seven months because of the difficulty of analyzing ancient scripts that are no longer in use.</p>

<p>I analysed a total of <strong>5 old newspapers</strong>, and the following report is a part of the analysis of one of the newspapers. This newspaper was published from <em>1896 to 1899</em>. The main tasks I performed were as follows.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Programming a crawling software for text mining</li>
  <li>Preprocessing by buidling a bag-of-words model</li>
  <li>Frequency based text analysis</li>
  <li>Built DTM(document-term matrix), TDM(term-document matrix), and covariance matrix</li>
  <li>Co-occuring word analysis</li>
  <li>Network analysis</li>
  <li>TF-IDF(term frequency-inverse document frequency) measure</li>
  <li>Linkage analysis</li>
  <li>Topic modelling</li>
</ul>

<p>Usually preprocessing takes up most of the text analysis work. It was especially difficult because it was necessary to translate the ancient Korean into a modern language.</p>
